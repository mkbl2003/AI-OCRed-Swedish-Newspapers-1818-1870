# AI-OCRed Swedish Newspapers 1818-1870

The repository *AI-OCRed Swedish Newspapers 1818-1870* was created to give public access to all data, scripts and results relevant to my project done during a thesis preparation
course I attended on Stockholm University.

This repository contains data from the corpus *Swedish Newspapers 1818-1870* (Språkbanken Text, 2020), which is part of the larger corpus *KubHist* (Språkbanken Text, 2025). 
The goal of this project was to compare the overall quality of OCR data generated by *ChatGPT 5.1* (OpenAI, 2025) and *ABBYY FineReader* version 11 (ABBYY, 2011), and to compare the
similarities and differences between the aforementioned softwares in regards to the mistakes they make. 

## Features

This repository contains
* Segments of the photographed newspaper pages from Swedish Newspapers 1818-1870
* OCR-data generated by ChatGPT 5.1, using the aforementioned segments
* The files containing the results of comparing the two softwares with a ground truth, containing general results, results on character level and number of hallucination files
 
In addition, this repository contains the scripts used to
* Produce the picture segments
* Remove the tags in the ground truth files
* Generate OCR-data in ChatGPT 5.1 through API
* Generate the results necessary for this project
* Generate the final result files

## Installation

Press the doi-links below to get access to the above mentioned corpora. 

### Requirements

Use Python 3.11 or newer versions so that the scripts work. The third party library used in the scripts is *pymupdf*, which needs to be installed separately.  


## Acknowledgements

The script *generate_total_results.py* was written by myself, while the rest of the scripts were written mostly by Dana Dannélls, with slight adjustments done by myself and
ChatGPT 5.1.
